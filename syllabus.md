Leave out the newline(/n,std::endl) and add it in afterwards.
Also point out the need for a semi-colon at the end of a statement.

variable declerations and types, also naming conventions.
int answer

Functions - take input, and give output.
Fuction return types
We are gonna print it out to the screen, except we want functions to be flexible, so instead of just printing it, return the value.
Then you can do whatever you want with the value in the main function.  We could use that value to reiterate a new sum if we wanted.


Function decleration/respose

If operator for sizeTest.  Cover > < == != >=
Explain = vs ==

if->then->else->return

for loop
bugged code prints out the value twice to start.
Go in and commented out the code to make sure nothing else is printing it.
Change index to 1 instead of zero
Then move position of print statement
